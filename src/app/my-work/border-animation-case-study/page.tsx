        <p>
          As the designer, I was responsible for researching crypto users needs,
          analyzing other transaction apps, and creating the high-fidelity
          design. This involved researching the typical needs in cryptocurrency
          apps and designing solutions that address them.

            <span className="font-bold">Research & Competitive Analysis: </span>
            Focused on common crypto user needs like transaction speed,
            security, and clarity. Reviewed apps like Paypal, Phantom and
            MetaMask to analyze how they handle payments, swaps and highlight
            trends.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Design Approach: </span>I focused on
            having a minimalist design to avoid overwhelming users, ensuring
            that key actions like sending, swapping, and receiving are easily
            accessible. The dark theme aligns with other typical crypto apps.

            Created a natural interface for managing balances, transactions, and
            asset swapping, with NFC integration for tap-to-pay functionality.

            Designing the UI around NFC payments required users knew when to
            scan while maintaining a clean design.

          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Crypto Swaps: </span>
            Providing a simple swapping interface without overwhelming users
            with options was critical. Focused on keeping the choices visible
            but precise.

        <p>
          The app provides a straight forward user experience for cryptocurrency
          transactions, with a focus on minimalism and the actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also meant i had to focus on a simple dashboard, with easy access
          to send, recieve and swap assets. And ofcourse the NFC integration for
          a quick, modern and contactless payment. The main goal was the pack as
          many actions into a clean and secure design.
