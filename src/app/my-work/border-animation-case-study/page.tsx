          As the designer, I was responsible for researching crypto users needs,
          analyzing other transaction apps, and creating the high-fidelity
          design. This involved researching the typical needs in cryptocurrency
          apps and designing solutions that address them.

          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Research & Competitive Analysis:</span>
            Focused on common crypto user needs like transaction speed,
            security, and clarity. Reviewed apps like PayPal and MetaMask to
            analyze how they handle payments and swaps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Design Approach: </span>I focused on
            having a minimalist design to avoid overwhelming users, ensuring
            that key actions like sending, swapping, and receiving are easily
            accessible. The dark theme aligns with other typical crypto apps.

          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Figma High-Fidelity Design: </span>
            Created a natural interface for managing balances, transactions, and
            asset swapping, with NFC integration for tap-to-pay functionality.

            Designing the UI around NFC payments required users knew when to
            scan while maintaining a clean design.

          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Crypto Swaps: </span>
            Providing a simple swapping interface without overwhelming users
            with options was critical. Focused on keeping the choices visible
            but precise

        <h2 className="font-bold text-4xl">The result</h2>
        <p>
          The app provides a straight forward user experience for cryptocurrency
          transactions, with a focus on minimalism and the actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also meant i had to focus on a simple dashboard, with easy access
          to send, recieve and swap assets. And ofc the NFC integration for a
          quick, modern and contactless payment
