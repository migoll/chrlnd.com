        <p>
          I had an large role in this project, as we were a small team. My main
          focus was the OOUX process, which involved working on objects, based
          on our personas and developing the an object map.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also worked closely with user flows and ensured that both the design
          and technical solutions in the code reflected the OOUX results.

        <h2 className="font-bold text-4xl">OOUX process</h2>
        <p>
          The project was based on OOUX (Object-Oriented UX), where we created
          an in-depth object structure based on our personas.
        </p>
        <p>
          We first developed the object map, where we categorized and
          prioritized objects like adoptable animals, training, and tips and
          tricks. From there, we worked on user flows and a CTA matrix, which
          supported the users journey on the platform.

        </ul>
        <p>
          One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that prioritized objects
          (adoptable animals, training, tips, etc.) were visible and easily
          accessible to our users.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was solved through a thorough design process and optimized user
          flows, which were mapped based on our object map.

        <h2 className="font-bold text-4xl">The result</h2>
        <p>
          The final solution became a responsive platform where pet owners can
          find information on adoption, training, and care of animals. The
          platform makes it easy to find adoptable animals and includes articles
          with tips and tricks on pet care.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the results of our user flows are implemented which
          ensures users can quickly find the information they need.
